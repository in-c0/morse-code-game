 # Morse-Code-Interface-Unity
A simple Morse code typer interface in Unity

di-di di-dah-dah-di ðŸ’ƒ dah-dah-dah di-di-di-dah di ðŸ‘¯  (has sound effect ðŸ”Š) (works with any key / mouse input) 
(you can adjust the long-press detection duration to your liking, it's a bit of a challenge to find the perfect speed but you will eventually find it if you can type fast enough)
